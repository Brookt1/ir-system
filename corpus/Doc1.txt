Over the open ocean, I observed a thunderstorm. Only thick, 
heavy clouds and a roiling tide could be seen at the start, 
and everything was quiet. I was standing on my balcony looking 
out toward the horizon when I heard a quiet thunderclap. 
The clouds began to shut over the following few minutes 
and reflected lightning lit up the undulating ocean. 
The sun was obscured by the thunderheads, casting shadows 
across the scene. For a very long period, there was calm.
I turned to look up just as the first thunderclap struck clearly. 
It shone against the sky and the water, and when I blink, 
I can see its outline in perfectly reversed colors. 
Thereafter, more. Thunder appeared to be struggling to keep up 
as it rumbled and stalled. Suddenly, the clouds appeared to 
be tearing apart, and patches of dazzling blue gleamed above the gloomy water.
I then looked down and observed the waves. Every bolt was met with a brief 
period of surface-spreading light. I could hear the waves smashing as they 
became more violent, rising high.
Then the rain started. It deluged the sea and soaked the sand all at once 
and in sheets. I could only see the lightning as bursts of light since 
the fog was so thick. The rain was so intense that it drowned out the thunder. 
Everything was rhythmic light and shadow, quiet and sound, and all five senses 
were combined into one experience.
It abruptly came to a standstill. The storm broke out. Clouds began to separate 
like curtains. Still falling, but much more subtly now. 
With the exception of one signature, it appeared as though there had never 
been a storm. A nearly ferociously vivid rainbow covered the sky and the lake. 
The horizon was once again visible.
